# Constellation

Inter-systems Collaborative Workspace (ICCW): a multi-client (tenant = client) workspace that coordinates human + AI agents across ideation, research, architecture, and creative work.

## Core ideas
- Tenant isolation (identity, data, vector search, and integrations)
- Suggest/read-first agents with dedicated Memo + Draft domains
- Two-phase commit for promotion to canonical state (propose → approve → apply)
- Notion + GitHub first integrations
